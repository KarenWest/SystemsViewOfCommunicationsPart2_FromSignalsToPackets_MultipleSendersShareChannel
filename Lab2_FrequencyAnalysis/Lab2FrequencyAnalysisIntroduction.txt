Hello, everyone.
Welcome to the demo for the second lab.
In the first lab, we have introduced source
coding to our communications system.
The objective of source coding is to reduce the data traffic
through a communications system, by removing the redundancy in the source
information.
By far, our communications system is almost completed.
We have performed many different types of analysis and design.
For example, we have investigated the channel effect.
We have built the error correct coding and also the source coding.
All the previous analyses have been performed from one angle, that is,
in the time domain.
However, based on our daily life experience,
we know that sometimes if we look at that same thing
from different perspectives, we may have some interesting understanding.
And those interesting understandings may be very useful for our system design.
Now, the question is what will signals look like in another domain?
Here, I have my voice recorded and this is the time domain representation
of my voice.
We can easily tell how my voice will change as time goes by.
The question is how will this voice signal look like in another domain?
For example, here is the frequency domain representation
of my voice signal.
What kind of interesting phenomenon can we observe? At least now
I know my voice will occupy the spectrum with frequencies
less than 3k or 4k hertz.
In the following, I will use two Matlab programs
to show you how to perform time frequency analysis.
And more importantly, how such analysis will be beneficial for designing
our communications system.
